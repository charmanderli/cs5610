The scenery and trails in this park are breathtaking. This is a good place to visit whether you are solo or with friends and family. Most people will go around the island on the sea wall path but there are also a lot of cool places to see in the centre of the island as well. Sunset is beautiful and you get good view of west and north Vancouver", "section": "experiences", "likes":3},
